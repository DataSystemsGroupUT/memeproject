            "inally one of the liars came back, but they wouldn't fess up to everything because they aren't ready.  I've been waiting four months to talk to these people and the one that gets back online first is not ready? How can that be?  FOUR MONTHS have passed surely a person can confess everything and apologize or whatever.  So far what I've gotten from her is ; she didn't work at a flower shop, she didn't even attempt to visit me while I was at college, and her mom and her were never buddy buddy, and her mom was never pregnant.  Man I wonder what her mom would do to her if her mom knew she went around telling people, even her 'friend' denise, that her mom was pregnant.  Too bad I don't know how to get a hold of her mom, not liked I'd be that mean to do that, but If she doesn't start fessing up  soon, I sure wish that would happen.  However, that's all I've heard her say that she lied about.  Then denise told me she didn't score as high as she claimed she did on her SAT, I could really give less a damn about an SAT, because I took the ACT and on top of that my score wasn't all that great on it.  Then she lied about the acceptance of colleges.  Which I don't get why you'd do.  Guess my mind doesn't think like their's.  It also appears that I made her so upset that she probably won't get back online, and if she does she'll come up with a new screename and won't chat with me.  All I want to know is the truth,  I waited four months to hear it from somebody.  I know Denise hasn't told me all especially when she actually thought Clarissa's mom was pregnant.  So there has to be some lies she doesn't even know about.  I must be a magnet for all this drama and stress it seems to always come around at the worst time.  Oh well that's my life. The girl I'm talking about has a blog it's on my links of blogs, it's the clarissa link.  Not much on there since she's keeping her mouth closed, or I guess I should say keeping her fingers from typing.    Well besides all that I still feel sick and now I'm experiencing neck pains along with the rest of the problems I already mentioned.  Plus I got tons of junk in my throat.  I really hope the lord will help me get better so I'm good to go back to California August 20th for school.         \n",
            "text:             Well my chest is still hurting.  The pains in the side aren't as bad as they were.  I tried the medicine for a day but it made me have chest pain and made it even worse. Hopefully the pain in my chest and everywhere else will go away.  I really hope I get better soon.         \n",
            "text:               THE AMBER IS THE COLOR OF YOU ENERGY PROJECT    Originally posted late Saturday night but I figured I'd repost it again because I just freaking feel like it.  Plus I didn't use the title last time.  Ok let's start from the begining. My roommate felt nauseated this morning so that i was seeing bad signs popping up. Then the weather was over cast and dreary another thing is usually a bad sign to me. The other bad sign was that we got lost on Sunset BLVD map quest told us to turn right instead of left. So we were lost for a while went up and down two times in a row. Then finally we stopped at an ARCO gas station and dude told us we were 12 miles away and needed to keep going to Fairfax. Well it was way passed Fairfax. We saw many things I never thought I'd see before, like KTLA studio, Nickoloden studio, and the CNN, and the Palladium. Man there was millions of studios we saw. Then finally we got to the Tower Records line wasn't long and it was like 10 something am. so we went over to the book shop. Didn't find anything there then looked at magazines. Didn't find anything, but the place had the largest smut magazine selection I'd ever seen. Man jack off city for people probably of all sexual preferences. Rather interesting since I'm not use to seeing a whole section of porn magazines.   So Then we went back to Tower and I bought the Buffy Musical CD and No Doubt Maxium which is an interview CD, I figured I'd go buy the No Doubt thing too because I love No Doubt and I hadn't been able to find that anywhere. So then we got in the line and sat for a while then the moved the line to the dumpsters. Then we sat down again and tried studying some flash cards for our various classes, my roomies art, my spanish. I was too distracted then two friends from school came andthey got into line with us. The one was hungry so I went with her to get some subway. It was good I had a ham with cheese and lettuce. It was good. But I figured I'd get some Mountain Dew figuring it would make me act crazy enough to actually say something to Amber, instead of just looking and being in shock. So we wait in line then Joss Whedon drives and pulls into the sparking space I'm right in front of. Nice BMW and the liscense plate was awesome. Then eventually the line starts moving and I'm doing and singing weird and wacky shit to my roomie and my two new acquaintances from school. They think I'm freaking hilarious and loved my shirt that said 'I've had A BAD WEEK MAY I HAVE A HUG' and then the back said which some people didn't get to see because of my backpack but it said 'I'm in $40,000 debt due to Chapman University' Which they understood totally because they go there also. I swear our school likes to rape us of our money. But the closer we got the more like i felt one either I'm going to pass out, two I'm going to throw up or three I was going to die because my side pains had been starting up again. Caffenine BAD BAD BAD. We finally get into the store in the line and I'm like freaking. And Megan says she is so going to pass out when she gets up to Amber. She's freaking going insane and is going to flip. I started taking pictures. Then I guess I pissed off Michelle I forgot her last name , but she plays Dawn cause I kind of just said here. I didn't mean too but I was feeling rather not well and extremely nervous. After she signed the CD cover I shook her hand and said nice to meet you. The Joss I got him to sign my CD cover and I put out my hand and said nice to me you and he was like wow. Don't know if the wow was for my awesome hand shake, the fact i didn't give him shit for killing of my favorite character or for the blue finger nail polish i was wearing. I should of asked, but too nervous too because who was next. Bingo AMBER. I go to hand my CD cover and she already started reading my shirt and she was like aaaah She signed my CD cover and was like you sure can have a hug and i was like yeah and then i said can i get a pic with you too and she's like sure but i better get a hug first i was like yeah and my roomie was laughing when Amber was first started reading my shirt. It's all about getting attention and being memorable when you want to get noticed by someone famous. So I was dissing on my roomie cause she was having problems with the camera, while I had my arm around Amber who was bending over the table to pose for the picture. Man the smile on my face was huge. hahaha. Then I was like thanks, she said your welcome. Then she started talking to my roomie and said you must have waited a long time and my roomie was like yeah and said thanks. Then my roomie came to me and said the letter and i was like shit then i tried to get it back to her, bodyguard said you need to leave and i was like i forgot to give her this letter and then i just tossed over by her and she was signing Megan's CD cover during this and she looked over and said for me ahh sweet and she smile and blew me a kiss goodbye. Man the expression on my face must have been something. Because Megan was cracking up and so was my roomie. I should have stayed over there longer because my other friend Christina stayed and talked to her for two minutes. I wish I could have taken more pictures of Amber, especially when she blew me the kiss but I wasn't expecting that at all. Well I hope she reads my letter and maybe I'll get a response. Now that would be cool, if not oh well guess I just have to live with that. Also she was like oh cool your finger nails match your tshirt that's awesome. Too bad being the loser I am all I said was yeah and yeah and yeah and yeah and just smiled, I had like so many things to say and all but for some reason I just couldn't say anything I was so in like awe. There is more to it than that too, but I'm not going to dwell on that too much. This will probably be the only time I'll ever meet her. But it truely made up for the bad week, month, year I was having. She truly made me happy and I really appreciate it. She probably couldn't even comprehend how much it meant to me that she said as much as she said too me. Also how much blowing a kiss to me meant to me either. I was like completely happy. I guess now the past is the past and I'm going to try to start a new. Forget about past and just remember everything from that moment in time and after. I gave her the web address to this site, and if she actually made it through the letter that I know was depressing and saw the website and actually came that'd be cool. It truly was a great day for me, maybe all the pain I've been through will slowly disapear. Amber Benson is the greatest.           \n",
            "text:             I need to add another link to my blog  That's Christina's website  urlLink   .  She's a super huge Buffy Fan, her like computer is like all buffied.  I haven't seen it yet, but I've heard.  She even has the pilot episode of Buffy with the ugly looking Willow on there.  I'm looking forward to seeing that.  Hahaha.  But check out her site it's cool.  Her top 10 list are the best.         \n",

            "text:             Still sort of on my happiness buzz from yesterday.  Man I hope I can stay happy for some more days.  Probably won't happen due to the fact classes stress me out to the max.  Still got to redue an AD and come up with 2 more ADs.  Then I have to find my favorite pop up AD for one class and type up why I like it and why it's effective.  Then the major thing today is we are going to be filming at like 9 something our gravedigger montolouge for Intro To Visual Storytelling.  I feel so horrible I was in charge of location and I couldn't freaking find one because I'm not from around here.  My group probably so hates me now and is going to talk shit about my films now.  Dude I try my best, things just never come out how I want them.  I'm sure glad now that I'm not a film major.  Advertising isn't much better since you kind of have to communicate with people, and I'm not a talkative person.  Plus I'm never always sure of myself, that's probably because everyone else is never sure of me.  Oh well, I try my best, because that's what you always should do is do the best that you can. Man my neck and side are really bugging me.  I guess I should take my medicine now for those side pains. Man I haven't heard this Counting Crows song in a long time.  'Round Here' awesome song.  But what song to me isn't awesome.  Listening to this song it sounds like a lot of my life.  Yep my life is weird and messed up.  Especially if you've read posts way in the past.  Well now I need to go get the contacts in and change the clothes to get ready to go shoot some montologue with the boys.  How come anytime I get put in groups I always get put in a group with a bunch of guys and I'm the only girl?  I guess everyone just considers me one of the guys or something.          \n"

            "p to everything because they aren't ready.  I've been waiting four months to talk to these people and the one that gets back online first is not ready? How can that be?  FOUR MONTHS have passed surely a person can confess everything and apologize or whatever.  So far what I've gotten from her is ; she didn't work at a flower shop, she didn't even attempt to visit me while I was at college, and her mom and her were never buddy buddy, and her mom was never pregnant.  Man I wonder what her mom would do to her if her mom knew she went around telling people, even her 'friend' denise, that her mom was pregnant.  Too bad I don't know how to get a hold of her mom, not liked I'd be that mean to do that, but If she doesn't start fessing up  soon, I sure wish that would happen.  However, that's all I've heard her say that she lied about.  Then denise told me she didn't score as high as she claimed she did on her SAT, I could really give less a damn about an SAT, because I took the ACT and on top of that my score wasn't all that great on it.  Then she lied about the acceptance of colleges.  Which I don't get why you'd do.  Guess my mind doesn't think like their's.  It also appears that I made her so upset that she probably won't get back online, and if she does she'll come up with a new screename and won't chat with me.  All I want to know is the truth,  I waited four months to hear it from somebody.  I know Denise hasn't told me all especially when she actually thought Clarissa's mom was pregnant.  So there has to be some lies she doesn't even know about.  I must be a magnet for all this drama and stress it seems to always come around at the worst time.  Oh well that's my life. The girl I'm talking about has a blog it's on my links of blogs, it's the clarissa link.  Not much on there since she's keeping her mouth closed, or I guess I should say keeping her fingers from typing.    Well besides all that I still feel sick and now I'm experiencing neck pains along with the rest of the problems I already mentioned.  Plus I got tons of junk in my throat.  I really hope the lord will help me get better so I'm good to go back to California August 20th for school.         \", 124055727], [\"           Well my chest is still hurting.  The pains in the side aren't as bad as they were.  I tried the medicine for a day but it made me have chest pain and made it even worse. Hopefully the pain in my chest and everywhere else will go away.  I really hope I get better soon.         \", 222403160], [\"             THE AMBER IS THE COLOR OF YOU ENERGY PROJECT    Originally posted late Saturday night but I figured I'd repost it again because I just freaking feel like it.  Plus I didn't use the title last time.  Ok let's start from the begining. My roommate felt nauseated this morning so that i was seeing bad signs popping up. Then the weather was over cast and dreary another thing is usually a bad sign to me. The other bad sign was that we got lost on Sunset BLVD map quest told us to turn right instead of left. So we were lost for a while went up and down two times in a row. Then finally we stopped at an ARCO gas station and dude told us we were 12 miles away and needed to keep going to Fairfax. Well it was way passed Fairfax. We saw many things I never thought I'd see before, like KTLA studio, Nickoloden studio, and the CNN, and the Palladium. Man there was millions of studios we saw. Then finally we got to the Tower Records line wasn't long and it was like 10 something am. so we went over to the book shop. Didn't find anything there then looked at magazines. Didn't find anything, but the place had the largest smut magazine selection I'd ever seen. Man jack off city for people probably of all sexual preferences. Rather interesting since I'm not use to seeing a whole section of porn magazines.   So Then we went back to Tower and I bought the Buffy Musical CD and No Doubt Maxium which is an interview CD, I figured I'd go buy the No Doubt thing too because I love No Doubt and I hadn't been able to find that anywhere. So then we got in the line and sat for a while then the moved the line to the dumpsters. Then we sat down again and tried studying some flash cards for our various classes, my roomies art, my spanish. I was too distracted then two friends from school came andthey got into line with us. The one was hungry so I went with her to get some subway. It was good I had a ham with cheese and lettuce. It was good. But I figured I'd get some Mountain Dew figuring it would make me act crazy enough to actually say something to Amber, instead of just looking and being in shock. So we wait in line then Joss Whedon drives and pulls into the sparking space I'm right in front of. Nice BMW and the liscense plate was awesome. Then eventually the line starts moving and I'm doing and singing weird and wacky shit to my roomie and my two new acquaintances from school. They think I'm freaking hilarious and loved my shirt that said 'I've had A BAD WEEK MAY I HAVE A HUG' and then the back said which some people didn't get to see because of my backpack but it said 'I'm in $40,000 debt due to Chapman University' Which they understood totally because they go there also. I swear our school likes to rape us of our money. But the closer we got the more like i felt one either I'm going to pass out, two I'm going to throw up or three I was going to die because my side pains had been starting up again. Caffenine BAD BAD BAD. We finally get into the store in the line and I'm like freaking. And Megan says she is so going to pass out when she gets up to Amber. She's freaking going insane and is going to flip. I started taking pictures. Then I guess I pissed off Michelle I forgot her last name , but she plays Dawn cause I kind of just said here. I didn't mean too but I was feeling rather not well and extremely nervous. After she signed the CD cover I shook her hand and said nice to meet you. The Joss I got him to sign my CD cover and I put out my hand and said nice to me you and he was like wow. Don't know if the wow was for my awesome hand shake, the fact i didn't give him shit for killing of my favorite character or for the blue finger nail polish i was wearing. I should of asked, but too nervous too because who was next. Bingo AMBER. I go to hand my CD cover and she already started reading my shirt and she was like aaaah She signed my CD cover and was like you sure can have a hug and i was like yeah and then i said can i get a pic with you too and she's like sure but i better get a hug first i was like yeah and my roomie was laughing when Amber was first started reading my shirt. It's all about getting attention and being memorable when you want to get noticed by someone famous. So I was dissing on my roomie cause she was having problems with the camera, while I had my arm around Amber who was bending over the table to pose for the picture. Man the smile on my face was huge. hahaha. Then I was like thanks, she said your welcome. Then she started talking to my roomie and said you must have waited a long time and my roomie was like yeah and said thanks. Then my roomie came to me and said the letter and i was like shit then i tried to get it back to her, bodyguard said you need to leave and i was like i forgot to give her this letter and then i just tossed over by her and she was signing Megan's CD cover during this and she looked over and said for me ahh sweet and she smile and blew me a kiss goodbye. Man the expression on my face must have been something. Because Megan was cracking up and so was my roomie. I should have stayed over there longer because my other friend Christina stayed and talked to her for two minutes. I wish I could have taken more pictures of Amber, especially when she blew me the kiss but I wasn't expecting that at all. Well I hope she reads my letter and maybe I'll get a response. Now that would be cool, if not oh well guess I just have to live with that. Also she was like oh cool your finger nails match your tshirt that's awesome. Too bad being the loser I am all I said was yeah and yeah and yeah and yeah and just smiled, I had like so many things to say and all but for some reason I just couldn't say anything I was so in like awe. There is more to it than that too, but I'm not going to dwell on that too much. This will probably be the only time I'll ever meet her. But it truely made up for the bad week, month, year I was having. She truly made me happy and I really appreciate it. She probably couldn't even comprehend how much it meant to me that she said as much as she said too me. Also how much blowing a kiss to me meant to me either. I was like completely happy. I guess now the past is the past and I'm going to try to start a new. Forget about past and just remember everything from that moment in time and after. I gave her the web address to this site, and if she actually made it through the letter that I know was depressing and saw the website and actually came that'd be cool. It truly was a great day for me, maybe all the pain I've been through will slowly disapear. Amber Benson is the greatest.           \", 124055727], [\"           I need to add another link to my blog  That's Christina's website  urlLink   .  She's a super huge Buffy Fan, her like computer is like all buffied.  I haven't seen it yet, but I've heard.  She even has the pilot episode of Buffy with the ugly looking Willow on there.  I'm looking forward to seeing that.  Hahaha.  But check out her site it's cool.  Her top 10 list are the best.         \", 124055727], [\"           Was looking through some blogs because I was bored saw this on one decided I'd do it too, because I'm that damn bored, and the high of happiness I had yesterday has gone away.

            "       Had a pleasant night with the family. Trevor's paperwork from the doctors and hospitals came however, so we were a little down. I think that Bill is having a harder time with it then he will admit as the papers brought him to tears last night. All I can do it hold him as we're both going through the same thing. Losing a child is never something I want to have to go through again. Looking at Teagan brightens both of our thoughts though so that is a help for sure. Yesterday I did pretty ok I guess. I had some oatmeal for breakfast, then some beef stroganoff for lunch, then 3 chocolate chip cookies at school while we dropped off some paperwork because I promised Teagan a snack and well I couldn't help myself but to get myself some as well. Then I had some tuna and cheese pasta salad for dinner. Then I had a Reese's that Bill brought me, and some potatoes with cheese. I really need to have a talk with him about not bringing me junk like that. I know he does it just to be sweet and doesn't think much of it but he sure brings a lot of junk into the house that I can't seem to turn away from. Also been feeling guilty about the amount of snacking I let Teagan do as I don't want him to have the same problems as I do. I missed my therapy session last night because I had to work. However after talking to an old support group buddy yesterday she has changed all of her eating habits on her own just by focusing on herself more and realizing what her problems are. Perhaps I could do that with my Prozac and not paying some lady to listen. Who knows. Perhaps I just don't want to go back. I just hate having to rely on Prozac and a therapist to feel like I can fix my problems. Why can't I just fix them on my own? I think I'm going to try Weight Watchers to see if that helps me stay on track. Just for the accountability and the ideas of healthy cooking. I'm having a hard time coming up with healthy things to cook all the time so it's just easier to revert to my old ways.         \n"

            "       Well it was my birthday so I allowed myself to have 2 peices of cake and not feel guilty. Although, now that I look back I am feeling guilty lol. Anyhow, with me being at work all weekend I really ate a lot better. I had some slips, but that's ok. I am a bit nervous about getting bored at work and wanting to eat from the vending machine because on Sunday things are pretty slow there so there is a lot of down time where we can just dink around on the internet; however I got bored and went straight for the vending machine. So I've got to leave the money at home so I can't do that. I think that's a good solution. When I bring something to eat for lunch though I'm amazed at how full I feel when I'm busy and not focusing on food. My surgery actually is working if I would allow it. If I could just get control over my brain. I have therapy tonight but need to reschedule because I have to work. Although now that I have a lot going on it doesn't seem to be something I want to do now. Perhaps I don't need therapy, I know I do but I don't want to go. How's that? I sure don't want to take that hour that I could be spending with my family and spend it lying on the couch listening to her tell me what to do to fix my problems cause I think they're unfixable. I can't find her phone number anywhere to reschedule so hopefully she calls me to verify my appointment. Don't really feel too much different being 26, just feel like I should have more of myself figured out as I'm getting a little older. Hubby's birthday is the day after tomorrow and he's gonig to be 30 I wonder how much of himself he has figured out. They say you're supposed to really grow up at age 30 so I'm anxious to see if it actually happens with him cause he doesn't have much growing up left to do just in the finances department.          \n"

            "       It's amazing how little I actually need to eat when I'm not thinking of food. Today was my first day at work and I had a breakfast burrito for breakfast, then a vegetable soup for lunch, bag of mm's and then dinner and some snacks after that. I wasn't bored so I wasn't in there looking for food. I was thinking about it the whole time I was at work though hence the mm's. I didn't really crave them just felt like I was being too good so I had to sabotauge it in some way. Maybe that's my problem perhaps I won't let myself succeed. It was a great day though. My first day working in almost 3 years and I felt so good. I did miss my husband and son but it sure was neat to come home to them after a day at work. I truly am blessed with a fabulous husband and a wonderful son. My husband deserves so much more thanks then I can ever give him. I came home to a clean house and laundry done. Although he's banned from laundry cause all my new clothes need special wash instructions and he never pays attention to that lol Went shopping yesterday for clothes and it was so fun. I kept looking in the mirror thinking why would want to wreck this? Why would you want to go back to buying huge clothes that are not fun to pick out and ruin this body I've worked to get. Damn I've done a good thing and just seem to want to wreck it but I'm determined not to let food take me over again. I'm trying.         \n"

            "       Another lazy day here at the house. I'm still in my pajamas and Teagan doesn't even want to get dressed so he's just in a diaper. Feeling bummed I'm going to miss the circus day with Bill and Teagan tomorrow, but oh well. Had another snacky night, but so far today I've not had a desire to overeat and the small temptations that have come in I've been able to ignore today. It's weird how it changes so much from day to day. I had 1/2 bowl of cereal for breakfast and then for a snack I had some celery with peanut butter. That was good lemme tell ya. And since then I had one urge to just grab something but it went away quickly so I didn't pay it much notice. I wonder why that was so easy to ignore today but in the evenings it's near impossible to ignore. I don't get it. Last night my weakness was Doritos that I had bought at the dollar store and some ice cream Bill brought home from Culver's. You know it's kinda starting to piss me off that he doesn't pay more attention to what he brings in the house. He knows I'm struggling with my temptations so why would he bring ice cream home? I think it's cause he truly doesn't understand what I'm going through. Either that or he just thinks I'd like the treat and it's only one. Who knows but we don't make the greatest pair when it comes to our food problems. Maybe I should tell him not to bring temptation into the house but I think it's the only thing he knows to do to try and cheer me up or do something special for me and gosh forbid he sit down and think of some new way to brighten my day. Who knows, but I don't need the extra temptation. That ice cream he got me is going to last for days so I'm just going to struggle every day to fight it off and then end up eating it. In fact I think I'll go get some now.          \n"

            "       We had a late night last night. We were up discussing what to do about Teagan and having to go to a babysitter while I'm in class. Neither of us are comfortable with the idea of handing over our only child to a stranger for 8 hours a day. By the end of the night we had decided that I would wait 2 years to go to school and I'd just continue to stay home with Teagan during the day. I was up a long time after Bill fell asleep because not only do we have to worry about what we feel, but we have to make sure we're doing the best thing for Teagan. We hadn't considered what effect it would have on him to be home with me for 5 years in a row. The way he stands at the fence longing to go and play with other kids, or the way he follows the older kids around the neighborhood because they don't want to play with him but he doesn't care. We don't want him growing up and getting beat up all the time cause he's a mamma's boy. After waking up I called Bill at work again and we discussed it further and decided to go ahead and check out some home care places. Luckily the first one I went to this morning I loved. Not only are all her other kids she takes of Teagan's age, but she has tons of animals that he can play with and learn how to be around. The only disadvantage is that she doesn't do anything educational, but I figure he has 12 years of school ahead of him to get educational knowledge, why not let him enjoy his childhood as much as possible. I left him with her for an hour while I ran to an appointment sorta as a trial run and he didn't want to leave when I came to get him so I am feeling pretty good about it. We'll see how I feel the first 8 hour day without him by my side constantly. I sure am glad we decided this way though cause I sure would like to get school over with sooner rather then later.   Last night I did pretty good with my eating I think. We had taco salad for dinner and I just snacked on that all night and since it's mostly meat and vegetables I didn't feel too guilty but of course since I ate on it all night long I still felt guilty. I really think that I am too hard on myself sometimes, but oh well. I also had some clementines too. I woke up this morning feeling rather full so I skipped breakfast but got super hungry around 11 so I don't think I should do that anymore cause then I really wanted to just stuff whatever I could get my hands on in my face and I did with a candy bar. So that wasn't a smart choice to skip breakfast, so I'm going to try to make sure I at least eat something for breakfast every morning.   I'm a little nervous about everything that is coming up. Teagan, school, work and I don't want to fail at any of it so I'm under a bit of stress and I haven't even started. I know I'm smart enough for school, but I still haven't figured out why I'm so lazy so hopefully I get that figured out before I'm bogged down with homework.         \n"

Got registered for my classes yesterday and that'll keep me busy too as I've got 4 classes to keep up with, plus work, plus my family.

I keep stepping on the scale too and my weight is changing daily which is frustrating cause then when it goes down I tell myself I'm not doing that bad and allow myself to eat some more. I'm registering for school this week so hopefully the busy tasks of school and working part time and my family will keep me away from the food. I thought a lot last night about what I like to do for enjoyment and I just really can't come up with someone other then the computer and laying on the couch being a couch potato. Those don't seem to me like valid things of enjoyment. Who knows. I did however take an hour last night and get on the computer while my son and husband played upstairs and that was just my time, although I was down here feeling guilty for doing so the whole time.

            "       Well today was the first day with the new therapist. To tell the truth I don't even remember her name. I didn't really care cause at the beginning I thought for sure I wouldn't like her. I was shocked to know her knowledge of gastric bypass so I was intrigued. However, most of the session went to talking about ways to help with my son and his behavior, but that's ok because that could help me too. Although I wish she would of given me some type of assignment for the week because I know I'm just going to stuff myself with more food and it seems the more I try, the more food I eat. I wish I could figure out why I eat so much but maybe I already know and just don't want to face the answer. That's probably what it is. Every time I get close to figuring it out I leave the therapist, perhaps I should notice a pattern.   She did ask me some questions that I really didn't have any answers to. Like what do I like to do with my spare time. Well hell I don't know. Ever since I was 17 I've been involved with someone and then became a mother. I've never just been me so how am I supposed to figure out what I like or what type of person I am? I keep saying I want to be a teacher and that's why I continue to try to finish college, but do I really? Why do I want to be? I can't really answer that. I think it's cause it's what I've always thought I'd like and it would require too much thought to think of something new and I'm far too lazy for all that thinking. Or perhaps it's not lazyness but actually the way I am. How am I supposed to figure it out and why do I even have to. I guess maybe I just need some more Prozac.         \n"

            "       Well figured out why I'm having such a hard time controlling my food intake. I'm pregnant!!! Woohoo! We're so thrilled. Due date is April 28th. Looking forward to that and hoping that everything goes well. I am still going to do Weight Watchers though or I am going to let myself get completely out of control with eating since I have to eat more frequently for the baby. I still need to learn some responsibility so I'm going to do the WW at home program as soon as we can afford it. I got a bad speeding ticket so I think I better pay that first before I get in trouble hehehe. My mom and dad are coming to visit us this weekend and I couldn't be more excited. Teagan is excited too. It's been too long. So that will be fun to have my hang out buddy back. Met a new gal that is quickly becoming a super close friend and so between all of this I've been feeling really good about things. I even stopped taking my Prozac and am still feeling good so I'm hoping I don't need it anymore. So much for the fun clothes though, that's the only part I don't like. Oh well it's well worth it!! Now that I know I'll be having another baby soon I am going to start looking into getting my tummy tuck as soon as the baby is born because I can't stand this skin anymore, especially on my stomach so I'm going to start looking into that. I'll probably have to go back to Colorado for that though because my original surgeon tries to include it with the original surgery so that insurance will cover it so we'll see!!          \n"

            "       Well I keep gaining and losing the same three pounds for some time now. I don't know if this is how my life will be as a post op but I really want to get down to 155 pounds. I'm so close. I always quit everything though when I get close to acheiving my goal. It seems I can't let myself succeed at anything. Anyway, a friend of mine is sending me some Weight Watcher coupons and I'm hoping I can do that once they come but I'm sure I'll find some excuse not to. Don't I sound pathetic. Met a gal in Wisconsin finally and I had such a great time. I had such a great day. It felt so neat to meet someone and not be worrying about what they were thinking of my size. Instead I was wondering if she was going to kick me out of her house for teasing her too much lol. Teagan had fun with her kids too so it was great all around. Hope to get to see her again soon. She didn't think I was too crazy so that's a plus. I am so addicted to eating fruit lately that it's all I'm eating. Not doing so well with controlling the junk intake lately. Hoping that I get a boost from joining Weight Watchers or something. When I am not too lazy and really try then I do ok but I usually am too lazy to try. I'm just lazy all around lol          \n"

            "       It's been a little while. Seem to have been busier now that I'm working and not as much time to dwell on my failures so haven't had much to say lol. I'm really enjoying my job, and the time that it takes me out of the house and the independance of earning some money. However we came into a large conflict with me going back to school, and working as I just didn't feel that I could give my all to everything. I honestly believe that it's my role in this world to do something with children but I just don't think I want to be a teacher anymore. I think my role with children can be better served with my own child and bringing another child into the world and helping those that are at a disadvantage. Why waste all the money to go to school when I can help kids in a stronger way for free? lol Who knows. I know my mom is going to be pissed when I tell her my decision about school, and so I've been putting it off. Fear. All I've ever wanted to do is make her proud of me and she values school so highly. However, I value kids and my family at the same height she values school so I hope that some day she could understand that from me. With all this on my mind and the business of work and such I haven't been back to therapy. I don't really want to go back actually. I want to know that I'm strong enough to fix this on my own. Or perhaps the Prozac is working again and it's fixing me and I'm not really saying this or really strong enough to be fixing things it's the Prozac. I hate taking that but I'm afraid of what I'll turn into if I don't take it. If I'll turn back to food for my fix all or if I'll just lay in bed all the time and close out my family. I have been doing really well with my eating with all the distractions so I've figured out that is one thing I need to continue rather then turning to food for my entertainment since it's something I know I like in this world where I haven't spent much time trying to figure out what I like, I just need to figure out what I like to do and keep busy. I have some slips at work cause they have that vending machine and I keep getting candy bars. That weakness I haven't quite figured out yet. Some days I don't even care the candy bars are in there but if it's slow at work and there's not much going on then that's all that's on my mind. It's weird how food is involved in my life.          \n"

            "       Ok so I'm 7 weeks pregnant as of Monday, September 8th and I've gained 7 pounds. My lowest weight from the surgery was 166, now add 7 onto that. Egads!!! I feel like such a slosh. My pants are even getting snug. I can't believe 7 pounds can do that. Everyone keeps saying oh just ignore it you're pregnant. Screw that. Pregnant or not I'm only 7 weeks along, no normal person gains that weight. However, I'm scared to cut back on the eating though since the baby doesn't get as much as a normal baby anyhow, so I'm in a mess and it's driving me crazy and making me depressed. I'm back into my mode of trying to sleep all the time, granted I'm tired from the baby, I'm not doing anything around the house. I've just become lazy again so I need to get out of my funk. I gave it a start today by picking up the house a little. I just am so stuck. I mean I could eat healthier foods, but those aren't keeping me full either. I just don't know what to do. If I don't eat every so often I'm getting so sick. They pulled some blood on me yesterday and I asked them to run a blood sugar and a thyroid to see if that gives me any clues as to why I'm so hungry all the time. My shrink keeps calling for me to reschedule. I guess I should call her back but I'm not sure I liked her so much. I just don't know if I should be trying to work on my problems while I'm knocked up and it's driving me nuts. I mean literally it's almost all I think about. I am obsessed with this weight. Sure I could be exercising but what depressed, lazy, tired person wants to do that? Sure as hell not me that's for sure.   Had a really nice time with my parents visiting. Wish there was a way Bill could have his job and we could be close to my family but I don't know how to make that happen so here we sit. I miss my sister a whole bunch too and her phone has been broken so I haven't gotten to talk to her. She's turning 21 on October 18th and now that I'm knocked up I can't go get drunk with her for the first time ever. Sucks!   Hubby gets to go out of town in October and I'm super jealous we can't go on the trip with him. Oh well at least he'll get some time to relax, he deserves it.  So that's it for now I guess.          \n"

I can't take them in the morning however due to my morning sickness so I've been taking them at night even though the bottle says in the morning so I'm hoping that's ok.   So we're just trudging along. I've stopped stepping on the scale cause it was too depressing. I'd lost 7 pounds, then gain 2 then lose 5 then gain 6 it just is too much so I don't look at the doctor either. I know the baby needs it so I'm just eating like I should be for the most part. Since I can't keep a whole lot down I just eat what works. I've started dumping on the strangest things these days and I've heard this happens once you are a ways out from the surgery. It sucks. Oh well. Oh and I look pretty goofy getting pregnant with all this skin yeah it's yucky I don't know how Bill gets turned on by all this but he still does so guess I'm good to go.          \n"

            "       Ahhhh it's been a while I know, so sorry. My pregnancy is 22 weeks along and it's going very well. We are having a girl, so we're thrilled. I am a bit nervous about having a girl but it must be meant to be that I have one! She's been doing so well after what happened with Trevor that I know it's meant to be.   I weigh 178 at my last checkup so that's rather bothersome but I know it's for the baby so I'm trying to ignore it. I don't step on the scale at home at all anymore. I went from 166 to that awful fast so it's kind of a shocker. I don't like it so much at all actually. My pregnant belly doesn't look like a normal one because of the extra skin so it really bothers me, but I try to not focus on it a lot and rather just grab something to eat lol. I've lost all focus on how to eat like a post op and such and I'm not beating myself up about it because I'm pregnant. I have to suffer enough being pregnant so there's no need to make the whole thing miserable with self punishment. After this is over I will be able to have much more control over my body.   Little man is doing so well. He's loving school, and we love having him go. We're hoping in the month of January there will be some more days open for him so he can go a few more days a week. We'll see. He loves it. Right now all he's focused on is what Santa is going to bring him for Christmas, he's dying for a GameCube, and Santa is going to deliver of course! You can definately tell he's my husband's child. He's very much into electronics rather then the regular toys.   That's it for now! I hope everyone reading this has a beautiful and blessed holiday season and much joy in the upcoming year. I can't believe it's 2004 already.         \n"

            "       Okeydokey; I know it's been a rather long time. I'm going to be 9 months pregnant on Monday and we're dying for this baby to get here. Been a long road. I'm weighing in at 196 as of last Wednesday so I've lost a few pounds in the last week, but that's ok. I was really hoping to not go over 200. I can't wait to not be pregnant any more. My body has been through so much in the last few years I just want to be normal again.   Lil man is in Colorado with his grandparents for a visit while we relax and wait for the baby to come cause she was trying to come early and I was put on bed rest and some medication that makes me super sick to stop the labor. He got tired of the trips to the hospital so we thought it would be the best thing for him. He's having a blast. Bill is anxious for the baby to come as well, it's been a long road for us. Can't wait to get back to 'normal'  I was going to school, but had to put that on hold as well because of the baby trying to come early, so a few of my professors are going to let me finish up after the baby comes so I'll be busy. Not working anymore so that helps.   So that's about it, just waiting for our new addition!!           \n"

            "       Our bundle of joy is here finally!! Shyla Lee was born on April 22nd at 3:09 pm, weighing in at 7 pounds and measuring 19' long. She was just an inch shorter then her brother. Delivery went well and she's doing just great. She's beautiful. If you want to see pictures you can see my family at http://www.geocities.com/billnjulie2001.  Hubby has been home on vacation for 2 weeks and this is his third. He'll be going back on the 17th and I'm a little nervous about having a full house, but think it'll be fun.   Top weight that I got to during pregnancy was 198 pounds and when I got home from the hospital I weighed 188 and now I fluctuate between 181-183. I was at 166 before I got pregnant with Trevor so I'm hoping to get back down to that. However, I have noticed my hips are wider and I don't know how to fix that. Sure is hard returning to cutting back on my food intake I'll tell you that much.   Well the little one is awake so I must go!!  Julie         \n"

Teagan seems to be feeling the stress too as he's acting out pretty badly, but we're trying to go easy on him. Hopefully it's over soon.

            "          Ugh you'd think after all that I've put my body through to get thinner that I'd eventually have figured out why food is so much a part of my life, but yet I have not. Here I sit as I'm thinking, thinking, thinking about food and I can't stop. It consumes my day!! No matter how busy I am with the kids all I think about is what I can eat. Was supposed to be doing South Beach with a friend of mine to get some of this baby weight off and the first day I blew it. I swear it consumes my life. Then when I do give in and eat something I feel guilty and then I think screw it. Oh what frustration! I thought having the gb surgery would help this, but after doing a lot of research and talking to many in support groups after 2 years a lot of people that have had the surgery go through realizing the the surgery didn't fix anything, it was just another quick fix that you can mess up like any other diet. Would I do it again? Probably because it was nice being skinny for the short time that I was. I'm not as huge as I was right now by all means, but if I keep eating this way I'll get there. I thought the malabsorption would help control that but it doesn't. Nobody knew the long term effects of the surgery when I had it because it was new and not many people had it long enough to see what it does.   \n"
